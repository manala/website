## Preparing your project

For this example we'll used a PHP/Symfony project.
Depending if you are already using the manala project or just want a deployment solution, you should have (or create) a directory named `manala` (or whatever you want to name it).

You should have an arborescence similar to:

```
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── ansible
├── app
├── bin
├── composer.json
├── composer.lock
├── features
├── package.json
├── src
├── tests
├── var
└── web
```
